# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a practice used to track the many different stages that a file (or files) goes through as it gets worked on. Developers use it to create 'save points' in a file, which can be returned to if something goes wrong. This controlled process of updating the code keeps it safe and provides easy ways to save your code from being broken.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a copy of the master code. Typically branches are dedicated to a specific change or feature that you want to add to the code. Branches should be used because they keep the new code separate from the master code, ensuring that the master code remains safe and that the new additions are reviewed before being merged.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is when a new 'save point' is created for a file. The message that accompanies the commit should clearly explain the changes being committed. These messages are written in the present tense. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when there are multiple edits to the same line of code, or if someone is trying to make changes to a file that was deleted.
