/* ---Finding the Longest Phrase---
- Input: an array
- Output: a string

- First, create an empty string variable to contain the longest phrase
- Then, initiate a loop to iterate over each item in the array
- Compare the length of each item in the array to what is contained in the 'longest phrase' variable
- IF the item at the current iteration is longer than what is in the string, reassign the string to contain the current item
- return the 'longest phrase' variable
