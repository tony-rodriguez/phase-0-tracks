<!-- *Semantic tags are meant to describe its contents. For example a form tag clearly lets you know that it contains a form. The ones I see as most useful are tags like header, footer, and nav, because for these items there is no confusion as opposed to some other tags where they serve a similar purpose and you have to decide which one to use.

* The browser reads the HTML elements from top to bottom, which is the order in which the elements are displayed (unless they are formatted differently using CSS.)

* The main thing I learned about Sublime in this challenge was how to make a snippet. I can definitely see myself creating new snippets in the future if I find myself creating many similar types of files that can follow a template to start off.

* We had a little struggle when getting the snippet to work, but that was only an issue with syntax rather than a conceptual issue. I was a little unclear on the section about semantic elements, because we were trying to figure out exactly what each one meant while simultaneously trying to implement them into our document as quickly as possible. I can easily improve my understanding of these elements by spending more time studying and practicing with these elements. -->
